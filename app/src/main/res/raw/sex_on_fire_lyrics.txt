Sex on fire









Lay where you're laying
Don't make a sound
I know they're watching
Watching
All the commotion
The kiddie like play
It has people talking
Talking
You
Your sex is on fire
The dark of the alley
The breaking of day
Head while I'm driving
I'm driving
Soft lips are open
Them knuckles are pale
Feels like you're dying
You're dying
You
Your sex is on fire
Consumed
With what's to transpire
Hot as a fever
Rattle of bones
I could just taste it
Taste it
But it's not forever
But it's just tonight
Oh we're still the greatest
The greatest
The greatest
You
Your sex is on fire
You
Your sex is on fire
Consumed
With what's to transpire
And you
Your sex is on fire
Consumed
With what's to transpire
